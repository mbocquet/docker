# roles to prepend the docker-compose command with TMP={{ docker_tmpdir }}
#
# docker_tmpdir: /var/lib/docker/tmp

# docker_distribution_codename is used to force the distribution in case the
# target systems are testing or unstable. Docker repository only contains

#     compose_template: myapp-docker-compose.yml.j2
#     image: provider/image-name:1.1.5
